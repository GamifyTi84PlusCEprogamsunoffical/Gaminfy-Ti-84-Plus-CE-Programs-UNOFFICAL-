# Gamify Ti 84 Plus CE Programs UNOFFICIAL
Self-explanitory! Whoops i just mispelt "gamify." Lol!

Programs include:
-Desmos Reference particularly in statistics so you know how to do tricky problems like Standard Deviation "stdev()".

PLEASE NOTIFY ME @ https://www.skool.com/@nicholas-volta-2410?g=gamifysat if anything's broken.

NOTICE: Due to this being a file transfer, you MAY have to replace each "pause" with Ti's pause function. There is no known fix at this time. If you do know a fix, please contact me @ https://www.skool.com/@nicholas-volta-2410?g=gamifysat

Likewise, it was brought to my attention that "SATMATH" program does not work. Please do not download it as it will NOT work.
